I need to write a software specification, and I need your help with writing it.

I want to build an asset cataloging application used for logging household items for insurance purposes. It must be in the form of a web application using TypeScript and Vite/React and must run on mobile devices as well as on a pc.

Here are some features I think I will need:

Take a photograph of the item and store some metadata against each item. Metadata stored must be make, model, serial number, description, value.
List all items in the catalogue.
Select an item and display it together with the photograph and metadata.
A value that totals all assets must also be displayed.
It must be possible to edit and delete an individual asset from the catalogue.

The output should be formatted as Markdown.

Ask follow-up questions if something is unclear BEFORE you start generating.
