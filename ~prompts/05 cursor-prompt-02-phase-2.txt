Continue with Phase 2 (data model & API) locally (implement TypeScript asset model and local mock API) using the software requirements (docs\02 specification.md) and the TODO list (docs\04 todo.md) to complete Phase 2 of the project in the source directory. Mark items as done in the TODO list only after verifying that the acceptance criteria have been met.
