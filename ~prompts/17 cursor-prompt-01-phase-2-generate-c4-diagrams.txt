Outputs to be stored in the ~architecture directory.

Act as a senior cloud architect and C4 modeling expert.
Generate C4 diagrams (Context, Container, Component, and optional Deployment) for the following Azure-based application.

1. System Overview
Application name: Assets Catalogue
Business purpose: An application used to store information about household assets. To be used for insurance purposes.
Primary users (roles/personas): Home owner
External systems: None

2. Functional Requirements
  -  The applicion is multi-tenant, each user has maintains their own asset list.
  -  Assets are added together with upto 4 photographs. Each asset is categorised and an estimated value assigned.
  -  An insurance claim pdf can be produced detailing asset data, together with photographs of the asset.
  -  A chatbot is included to provide guidance on all things insurance.
  -  The user interface support localisation in english, french, german and japanese.
  -  The user interface supports light and dark presentation modes.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Only authenticated users can access the application apis.

Scalability needs:
  -  None.

Availability requirements:
  -  99.9

Security/compliance requirements:
 -  None.

Performance constraints:
  -  None.

4. Azure Services to Use (if predefined)
Azure Entra Id, Azure Functions, Cosmos DB, Application Insights, Azure AI Foundry, Azure Storage, Static Web Apps

Output Requirements
For Each C4 Level:
1. Context Diagram
Show system boundary
Identify users and external systems
Describe relationships

2. Container Diagram
Break down into Azure services
Include databases, messaging, identity, networking
Specify technology choices

3. Component Diagram
Break down a key container (e.g., API or backend)
Show major components, responsibilities, and interactions

4. Deployment Diagram (Optional but preferred for Azure)
Map containers to Azure infrastructure
Include regions, VNets, subnets, scaling units
Show PaaS/SaaS boundaries
Formatting Instructions
Use Mermaid C4 syntax
Clearly label Azure services
Add brief explanation below each diagram
Follow official C4 modeling conventions

Keep architecture production-ready and realistic
If any details are missing, make reasonable Azure-native assumptions and document them clearly.
