You are a senior QA engineer and BDD specialist.

Using your knowledge of the application, generate a comprehensive set of technical user stories in the ~architecture\technical-stories folder written in valid Gherkin format (Feature / Background / Scenario / Scenario Outline / Given / When / Then / And).

Constraints and expectations:

Stories must:
Be technically precise and implementation-aware.
Reflect frontend/backend interaction.
Include API calls, HTTP status codes, validation rules, and error handling.
Cover authentication and authorization scenarios.
Include edge cases and failure paths.
Consider offline behavior relevant to a PWA.
Include Azure-specific considerations where relevant (deployment slots, configuration, etc.).

Structure:
One top-level Feature.
Include a Background section when appropriate.

Provide:
Happy path scenarios
Validation scenarios
Security scenarios
Concurrency scenarios (if applicable)
Error and retry scenarios
Performance-related acceptance criteria where relevant
Use Scenario Outline with Examples tables when appropriate.

Be explicit about:
API endpoint being called (e.g., POST /api/orders)
Expected request payload shape (high-level JSON structure)
Expected response shape (high-level JSON structure)
Expected HTTP status codes
State changes in the frontend
Persistence behavior in the backend
Write in strict Gherkin syntax only.
No explanations outside the Gherkin.

No commentary.
No markdown.
Only valid Gherkin content.

Assume the reader is a developer implementing automated tests using SpecFlow (C#) and possibly Playwright or Cypress for frontend E2E tests.

Generate a complete and thorough set of scenarios suitable for direct implementation.
