Add functionality to the "Add New Asset" screen to enable an estimation to be made for the current price of the new asset. The information should be obtained from sources abvailable on the internet and should be based on the age of the item and the meta data provided for the item. I need a new field adding to the asset object model named "Date purchased", this date should be used to ascertain the age of the asset.
