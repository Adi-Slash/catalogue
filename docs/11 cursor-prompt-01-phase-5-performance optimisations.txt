I've noticed that when the asset list loads on the main page it gets slower and slower the more assets that are added. It could be to do with the use of original images taken using the devices camera which are high resolution, meaning large amounts of data needs to be downloaded to show the page. It is important for the original images to be kept and displayed when the user selects an asset card to view and edit the assets. Can you provide a solution that enables the initial asset list to load as quickly as possible. Note that asset photos still need to be displayed on that list.
